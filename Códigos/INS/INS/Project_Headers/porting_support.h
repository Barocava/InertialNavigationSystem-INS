given a sequence of inline assembly instructions:

    report    reports a single message for entire sequence and stops codegen
    skip      assume all instructions are illegal, 
              stops codegen whenever an assembly sequence is found, 
              reports a single message per assembly sequence
    reset     returns to the previous stacked state, stack depth is one.
